Betatron ray (consentrated x-ray) Doesn’t damage equipment, but flakes it out. Emits radiation.
Laser (long range, minimal damage).
Electrolazer (kills living things by electrocution) fries circuitry. Works by laser → plasma → electricity arcing through plasma. Shorter range, High Energy cost.
Particle beam (hydrogen, speed of light) giant, high energy cost. Long range. Accurate. Pushes ship slightly backward.
Plasma cannon (faster projectiles using electricity) would push ship in opposite direction a bit more.
Plasma railgun (fast projectiles that can carry explosives. Really pushes ship backward.
Ion cannon – disable rather than destory. Wrecks ship, but not people. Pushes ship backward a bit.

Missiles

torpedos


Engines:
stabalizers:
Hall-effect thruster. Think stabalizers.

Impulse engines:
Nano electrokinetic thruster – expensive, big tubes.
Fuel Thruster – acceleration – Giant fuel storage.
ArcJet (uses fuel, but way more efficient)
Solar Sail (large, slow acceleration)
Dual mode propultion – Fuel needed, but more efficient

Helical engine module for fuel thrusters. (only works when moving really fast) 0 fuel usage because fuel is recycled.

Photon Rocket (needed to get close to ftl in conjunction with gravitational shield)
Gravitational shield (needed for ftl)
